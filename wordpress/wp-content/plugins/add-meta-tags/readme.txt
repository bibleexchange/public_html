A Free yet feature rich metadata plugin that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing and easier sharing of your content.

== Description ==

_Add-Meta-Tags_ is a Free metadata plugin for the _WordPress Publishing Platform_ that can optimize your web site for more efficient indexing of your content by search engines and easier sharing on social networks. It achieves this by generating machine friendly information about your content, called <em>metadata</em>, according to widely used standard specifications.

<strong>Notice about the development status</strong>

<br /><br />

The current feature set of this plugin is already beyond what I need or use, so further development and enhancement of the plugin is no longer in my priorities. Moreover, since the release of version 2.11.0, <strong>I do not provide any support</strong> for this plugin and <strong>I no longer recommend using it in production</strong>. Due to lack of free time, there are no plans to work on this plugin in the near future. If you continue using this plugin in <em>production</em>, you are on your own.

<br /><br />

Instead, <strong>I highly recommend planning your migration to other plugins</strong>. There are many excellent plugins that are actively maintained and fully supported in the WordPress Plugin Repository. For more information about how Add-Meta-Tags stores its data and general information about how you could migrate that data to other plugins, please read <a href="http://www.codetrax.org/projects/wp-add-meta-tags/wiki/Data_Storage">this page</a> of the wiki.

<br /><br />

Last, but not least, there are several strong indications that during the last months my plugins have been the target of spammers. Please be extremely cautious! I strongly suggest that you <strong>completely avoid</strong> any forks of this plugin or any third party downloads either standalone or as part of a support service. Instead, <strong>I strongly encourage you to migrate to other more modern and better maintained plugins</strong>.

<br /><br />

Also, please note that Add-Meta-Tags is not for sale.

More specifically, _Add-Meta-Tags_ can generate the _description_ and _keywords_ meta tags, _Opengraph_, _Schema.org_ microdata and JSON+LD data, _Twitter Cards_ and _Dublin Core_ metadata for your _WordPress_ content and archives, your _WooCommerce_ products and product groups, _BuddyPress_ profiles, and more.

It also supports advanced _title customization_ letting you take control of the title generation on every part of the web site. Moreover, a basic _breadcrumb trail_ generator is provided for use with hierarchical post types. Last, but not least, it lets you customize the _locale_ on a per post basis generating a proper `hreflang` link for a signle language and, also, is out-of-the-box compatible with _WPML_ and _Polylang_ multilingual plugins (through the WPML language configuration file that ships with the plugin). Finally, support for [Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://www.ampproject.org/) as generated by the _AMP_ plugin has been implemented.

Add-Meta-Tags supports internal caching of the generated metadata of content and media pages and thus contributes to the preservation of system resources on high traffic web sites. Metadata caching can also lead to slightly faster page load times in several cases.

Add-Meta-Tags was started in 2006. Please visit the [Add-Meta-Tags historical homepage](http://www.g-loaded.eu/2006/01/05/add-meta-tags-wordpress-plugin/).
