1. Enemy attacks us concerning this desire.

I love when the children imitate worship bc they feeling the presence of God.

Recognizing the feeling deep inside for God.

Satan then brings in confusion.

Deut 25:19; Ex 17:14

People forget but God doesn't.

If we want our need met, we have to obey God.

1. To have Knowledge of HOW to obey, we have to seek God diligently.

The enemy is trying to strip us of the knowledge of right and wrong.

- Be teachable.
- a time God winked at ignorance, no more.
- some twisting the word to say what they like. Questioning God, Why?

2. React to the Word.

Take action.

3. Must be a full and complete doing of God's Word.

Saul blamed the people for his incomplete Obedience.

## Monday Night - "Give Me Your Farthing"

Sis. Rita Ritchie

Text: Mark 12:41-44

- She cast all that she had.
- Jesus was watching
- Isaiah 33:23 "the lame take the prey."
- "Little is much when God is in it"
- All God wants is "your little bit"

## Tuesday Night - "Time to Build Up"

Sister Diana Blythe

Text: Jude 1-3, 17-25

Ecclesiastes 3:3

V.20 "building up yourselves on your most holy faith..."

- written to the sanctiified v.1
- common salvation - for all - all come by way of the cross of Christ; Christ is the door. V.3
- Had to stop to exhort : there is earnest contention needed; a holy struggle; spiritual battle
- Jeremiah : you must **SEEK** out the old paths.
